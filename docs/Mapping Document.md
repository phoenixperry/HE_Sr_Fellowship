What the fuck is an Area of Activity 

I have been a Course Leader at UAL since 2018, leading on both the MSc and BSc. On these courses of study I created the following units: 

MSc Creative Computing:  
IU000123 : Coding One: Advanced Creative Coding
IU000125 : Creative Making: Advanced Physical Computing
IU000126 : Coding Two: Advanced Frameworks
IU000127 : Creative Making: Advanced Visualisation and Computational Environments
IU000129 : Creative Making: MSc Advanced Project

BSc Creative Computing: 
IU000106: Coding One: Introduction to Creative Computing and Coding Practice
IU000107 : Critical Studies: A History of Computing and Computational Creativity
IU000108 : Creative Making: Design and Coding Visuals
IU000109 : Coding Two: Data, Maths and Methods
IU000110 : Computational Practices: Sound and Image Processing
IU000111 : Creative Making: Experience and Physical Computing
IU000112 : Coding Three: Web Development Studio
IU000113 : Critical Studies: Network Thinking
IU000114 : Creative Making: Experimental Human Computer Interaction
IU000115 : Coding Four: Collaborative App Development Studio
IU000116 : Computational Practices: Visualisation and Sensing
IU000117 : Creative Making: Big Data, The Self and Social Platforms

MA Internet Equalities
IU000145 :Feminist Coding Practices
IU000124 : Critical Studies: Computational Thinking and Creative Practice
IU000128 : Coding Three: Exploring Machine Intelligence
IU000118 : Coding Five: Approaches to Machine Intelligence


Additionally, I helped validate the MSc and Bsc and worked on them from their initial formation. I served as the MSc and BSc Course Leader for their first year of running in 2019. In 2020, I moved to work only on the MSc as the CCI grew in scale. 

In terms of influence, I have worked over the last three years to mentor and inspire my ALs and lecturers in take innovated approaches to the classroom from the ongoing reading and experimenting I have found useful, including thinking of how we teach using decolonial and transformational techniques from bell hooks and Kimberly Crenshaw. Most usefully, I have also cross applied ideas of material engagement from writers such as Simon Penny who speak for the need to for students to gain knowledge through procedural knowledge verses simply reading about a topic. Additionally, writers such Lamros Malafouis' How Things Shape the Mind, who speak passionately about how our tools impact our cognition has led me to help students to critically and reflectively consider how the digtal tools in our educational practices are impacting our ability to learn. Most recently, I'm doing a study on how we're using chatGPT for learning, collecting ethonographic understandings from my students who are reflecting on how it's impacting their journey. I plan to publish this either on Medium or as a paper, depending on how the outcomes develop .

If I reflect on how I teach, it has more in common with alchemy, meditation and yoga practices than most traditional forms of academic pedigogy. Valuing direct experience first and formost, I bring my students into the room. We move the furniture against the wall and sit on the floor holding hands. We sing. We write scifi. We dance. We play. I have a pedagogy of joy that infuses all I do.  

What learners think of as my way of teaching comes directly from profound experiences of embodiment as a disabled person in chronic pain forced to understand difficulty and suffering and meet it with surrender and self acceptance. At first this learning was something I was forced into and later came to deeply respect. I show up. I am here. Every day there is no fail, there is only do. I see my students as fellow travellers in this wonderful journey of engagement with the beauty of life. One of the most important ways I teach is learned from my time medidtating at the Tibet Center in the East Village of New York City with Pema Chödrön. Knowledge and understanding of what matters most will rip the the heart asunder with awe. It's the grace and joy, I show up with. 

After twenty plus years of teaching, I no longer plan in the strict sense. I show up. I feel the room, and we do what makes sense that day. Sometimes that's whisper secrets. Sometimes it's write c++. It depends.
