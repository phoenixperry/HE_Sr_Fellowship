##### At UAL
I helped validate the MSc and Bsc and worked on them from their initial formation. I served as the MSc and BSc Course Leader for their first year of running in 2019. In 2020, I moved to work only on the MSc as the CCI grew in scale. 

I have been a Course Leader at UAL since 2018, leading on both the MSc and BSc. On these courses of study I created the following units: 

**MSc Creative Computing:**  
IU000123 : Coding One: Advanced Creative Coding
IU000125 : Creative Making: Advanced Physical Computing
